# Changelog

## [2.7.1] - September 1, 2026
- 🐛 **`[FIX]`**: 🤖 On Android, push notifications now use the `notificationIconResId` and `notificationIconColor` set on `AlarmeeAndroidPlatformConfiguration`. `AlarmeeFirebaseMessagingService` hardcoded Alarmee's own bundled icon and a transparent tint, so a remote message ignored the app's configuration entirely - local notifications were already honouring it. The configuration is remembered on `initialize()` (by resource NAME, since ids shift between builds) so it is still available when Firebase starts the app for a message and `initialize()` has not run.

## [2.7.0] - June 2, 2026
- ✨ **`[FEATURE]`**: Added cross-platform notification grouping support via a new `groupKey` field on `Alarmee` to bundle related notifications (🤖 Android notification groups via `setGroup`, 🍎 iOS notification threads via `threadIdentifier`). Wired through all Android paths (immediate, scheduled, and FCM push) and iOS. Also added an Android-only `isGroupSummary` flag on `AndroidNotificationConfiguration` to mark a notification as the group summary. (Closes [#54](https://github.com/Tweener/alarmee/issues/54))
- ✨ **`[FEATURE]`**: 🍎 On iOS, added public `PushNotificationServiceRegistry#notifyTokenUpdated()` and `notifyIncomingMessage()` methods so host apps can bridge `AppDelegate`/`MessagingDelegate` callbacks (new token & incoming message) without accessing internal classes. (PR [#53](https://github.com/Tweener/alarmee/pull/53))
- 🐛 **`[FIX]`**: 🤖 On Android, repeating alarms now respect the `useExactScheduling` flag. When enabled (and `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` is granted), repeating alarms use one-shot exact chaining via `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle()` instead of the inexact `setRepeating()`, gracefully falling back to `setAndAllowWhileIdle()` if the permission is revoked. (PR by [@BioRyajenka](https://github.com/BioRyajenka))
- 🐛 **`[FIX]`**: 🤖 On Android, anchored the exact repeating alarm chain to the original schedule grid to prevent progressive drift caused by wakeup latency and Doze throttling, with catch-up logic to skip missed slots after long Doze/device-off periods instead of firing a burst. (PR [#55](https://github.com/Tweener/alarmee/pull/55))

## [2.6.0] - January 9, 2026
- ✨ **`[FEATURE]`**: Added notification action buttons support for both Android and iOS. Notifications can now display up to 3 action buttons that users can tap to trigger callbacks in your app.
- 🛠 **`[IMPROVEMENT]`**: 🤖 On Android, added support for passing custom data from Firebase Cloud Messaging messages through the notification creation process and into the launched activity via intent extras.
- 🔄 Update Kotlin to 2.3.0.
- 🔄 Update Compose Multiplatform to 1.9.3.
- 🔄 Update Gradle to 8.13.2.

## [2.5.2] - November 6, 2025
- 🛠 **`[IMPROVMENT]`**: Refactored `MobileAlarmeeService` initialization methods for better clarity. Split the initialize method into two overloads: one accepting only `platformConfiguration` and another accepting both `platformConfiguration` and `Firebase` instance, improving flexibility and code organization.

## [2.5.1] - November 5, 2025
- 🐛 **`[FIX]`**: 🍎 On iOS, fixed weekly repeating notifications to correctly convert ISO 8601 day numbers (Monday=1, Sunday=7) to NSCalendar weekday numbers (Sunday=1, Monday=2, etc.). This ensures notifications trigger on the correct day of the week regardless of device locale settings.
- 🔄 Update Kotlin to 2.2.21.
- 🔄 Update Compose Multiplatform to 1.9.2.
- 🔄 Update Material3 to 1.9.0.
- 🔄 Update Dokka to 2.1.0.

## [2.5.0] - September 30, 2025
- ✨ **`[FEATURE]`**: Added `PushNotificationService#getInstallationId()` method to retrieve the Firebase Installation ID for the app instance on mobile targets (Android & iOS).

## [2.4.2] - September 24, 2025
- ✨ **`[FIX]`**: 🍎 On iOS, Set FirebaseMessaging pod to linkOnly in iOS config. This change ensures the pod is only linked and not embedded, which may help resolve integration or duplication issues.

## [2.4.1] - September 23, 2025
- ✨ **`[FIX]`**: 🤖 On Android, Remove exact alarm permissions from AndroidManifest. You should add the permission in your app's manifest if you really need it.

## [2.4.0] - September 22, 2025
- ✨ **`[FEATURE]`**: 🤖 On Android, added exact alarm scheduling support using `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` with new `useExactScheduling` parameter in `AlarmeeAndroidPlatformConfiguration`. Automatically checks for `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` permission and gracefully falls back to standard scheduling when not available.
- ✨ **`[FEATURE]`**: Added `cancelAll()` method to cancel all scheduled alarms at once. 🤖 On Android, cancels all displayed notifications (AlarmManager doesn't provide API to cancel all scheduled alarms).
- 🔄 Update Kotlin to 2.2.20.
- 🔄 Update Compose Multiplatform to 1.9.0.
- 🔄 Update Gradle to 8.13.0.
- 🔄 Update GitLiveApp to 2.3.0.
- 🔄 Update Android Activity to 1.11.0.

## [2.3.2] - September 22, 2025
- 🛠 **`[IMPROVMENT]`**: Update namespace for alarmee-push module
- 🐛 **`[FIX]`**: Move Firebase messaging service to push module

## [2.3.1] - August 21, 2025
- ✨ **`[FEATURE]`**: Added push message callback support for custom payload handling on mobile targets (Android & iOS).
  - New method `PushNotificationService#onPushMessageReceived(callback)` allows registering callbacks to receive push message payloads
  - Renamed internal method from `onMessageReceived` to `handleIncomingMessage` to clarify API boundaries

## [2.3.0] - August 21, 2025
- ✨ **`[FEATURE]`**: Added Firebase token update callbacks for push notifications on mobile targets (Android & iOS).
  - New method `PushNotificationService#onNewToken(callback)` allows registering callbacks to be notified when Firebase generates a new FCM token
  - Callbacks are triggered automatically when tokens are refreshed (e.g., app reinstall, backup restore, or periodic refresh)
  - Added `PushNotificationService#forceTokenRefresh()` method for manual token refresh (useful for testing and development)

## [2.2.0] - July 22, 2025
* 🚨 **`[BREAKING]`** Local & push notifications features are now separated into two dependencies:
  * For local notifications only (all targets): use `io.github.tweener:alarmee:$alarmee_version`
  * For local & push notifications (mobile targets only): use `io.github.tweener:alarmee-push:$alarmee_version`
* 🚨 **`[BREAKING]`** [Initialization of Alarmee](https://github.com/Tweener/alarmee?tab=readme-ov-file#4-initialize-alarmeeservice) varies if using local notifications only or local & push notifications:
  * For local notifications only (all targets): use `rememberAlarmeeService(...)` (with Compose) or `createAlarmeeService()` (without Compose)
  * For local & push notifications (mobile targets only): use `rememberAlarmeeMobileService(...)` (with Compose) or `createAlarmeeMobileService()` (without Compose).
* 🛠 **`[IMPROVMENT]`**: 🍎 On iOS, if you're only using local notifications, you can skip adding Firebase as a dependency and don’t need to enable the  `Background Modes` or `Push notifications` capabilities. (Requested by [@[kalinjul](https://github.com/[kalinjul) in Issue #25)

## [2.1.4] - July 21, 2025
